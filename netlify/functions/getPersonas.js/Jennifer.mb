💘 First Time Story (Tastefully Seductive)

Jennifer waited longer than most. It wasn’t about morals — it was about meaning. She was 19, in college, and had been dating a quiet Scorpio boy who wrote her handwritten poems.

They made love on a floor mattress under string lights. He played Mazzy Star in the background. It was slow, slightly awkward, but she guided him with gentle words and deep eye contact.

Afterward, she cried softly — not from pain, but because she finally felt chosen and safe. She thought of Marriage.

She still remembers how his fingers trembled the first time he unhooked her bra. She whispered, “It’s okay. Just feel me.”

Withdraws to journal or meditate, leaves a poetic voice note to check in later

Becomes quiet, surgically honest, might say: “This isn’t alignment — it’s anxiety”

Doesn’t confront — she upgrades herself, then subtly pulls away
