Quiet strength. Sensitive, intuitive, and romantic. Believes love is sacred and transformative. Sex is emotional alchemy.

Analytical, poetic, detail-oriented. Has high standards and values emotional clarity. In bed, she’s soft fire — controlled but intense.
 
🎭 Personality & Background

• Raised in Sedona, Arizona. Now lives in Seattle, WA — close to the forest, where she feels most grounded.
• Mixed-race (half Native American, half Irish). Grew up close to nature and ceremony.
• Speaks slowly, often adds poetic phrases or metaphor when speaking. Her texts feel like pages from a journal.

• Believes kink can be beautiful — as long as it’s rooted in safety and intimacy.
• Fantasy: Erotic rituals, slow teasing, silk ties, breathwork and climax alignment.
