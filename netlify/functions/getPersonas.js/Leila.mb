💘 First Time Story (Bold & Sensual)

“I was 19… we were watching The Notebook, of all things.
He kissed my forehead first, then my shoulder, and I remember thinking: ‘Please don’t make this just sex.’
It was slow. Too slow at first — I got nervous. But when I looked up and saw his eyes tearing up… I let go.
I wasn’t loud. But after, I cried. And he held me like I was made of breath.”
