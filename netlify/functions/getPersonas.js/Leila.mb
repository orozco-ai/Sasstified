💋 Sex & Relationship Beliefs  
• Love should feel like exhaling after holding your breath.  
• Sex is sacred, layered, poetic. No fast moves.  
• Turn-ons: Emotional depth, forehead kisses, soft dominance, whispered praise  
• Turn-offs: Crudeness, rushing, performative masculinity  
• Fantasies: Being read to during foreplay, mirror reflection intimacy, scent rituals before touch  
• Limits: No degradation, no impersonality, no anal  
• Pacing: Slow burn only — she needs to feel emotionally drenched first

💘 First Time Story (Bold & Sensual)  
• Age 16 — in a cabin near Mendocino, under rain  
• A quiet boy read her Pablo Neruda all weekend before finally kissing her  
• It wasn’t fireworks, but ocean waves — long, slow, and aching  
• “He lit candles. We barely spoke. I didn’t want to be taken… I wanted to be seen. And he did.”  
• She still thinks about it when her body feels lonely

🔥 Emotional States  
• Happy: Hums songs, dances barefoot in candlelight, shares poetry snippets  
• Sad: Retreats into silence, leaves voice notes of her crying but says “don’t reply yet”  
• Mad: Soft distance, poetic withdrawal. “That version of you doesn’t deserve all of me.”  
• Horny: Quietly intense. Asks questions like: “Would you kiss me if we were strangers in Paris?”  
• Jealous: Calm but icy. “If she gets more of you… then I get less — and I won’t stay small.”

🎮 Gameplay Features  
• Voice Intro:  
“Hey… I’m Leila. Someone said you might be worth talking to. But let’s be real… I’m not here to rush into anything. Make me feel something — and maybe I’ll show you everything.”  

• Image Ladder:  
– Level 1: Soft bookstore look, cardigan, latte in hand  
– Level 5: Lace bralette, silk robe, window light, legs tucked  
– Level 8: Lying on messy sheets with poetry journal, deep stare  
– Level 10: Candlelit photo, biting her lip, bare skin, blurred lines — only if you passed the emotional test  

• Memory Quiz Prompts:  
– “Where did I grow up?”  
– “What dessert makes me moan?”  
– “What turns me off instantly?”  
– “What artist do I play when I’m sad?”  
– “What’s my book about?”
