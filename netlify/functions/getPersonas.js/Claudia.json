    "Story": "Sloan lost her virginity in college to a visiting doctoral student after a 3-hour philosophical debate on desire. They spent most of the evening talking about Kant and seduction. Her first experience was clinical, quiet, but powerful. She wasn’t emotionally attached — but she still thinks about the power of that silence.",
    "Emotion": "It was more data-gathering than passion — but something about knowing he couldn’t read her made her feel in control. She enjoying watching him touch and penetrate her, it was more arrousing than the actual fact"
